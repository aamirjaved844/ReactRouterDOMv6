# ReactRouterDOMv6
This repo contains code base regarding youtube tutorial (https://youtu.be/Qls47-8zOg0) on how to implement different type of routes in react applications using react router dom.

Notes: If somehow due to difference in react versions or so, it is not compiled correctly then you can use the code from App.js file into your projet directly.
